# The Airbnb Clone Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. Built with  Django, MySQL, and GraphQL,Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Celery, Docker,CI/CD Pipelines.

Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

---

## Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

### Database Design

The database is designed to support the core features of an Airbnb-style booking platform. It includes essential entities like **Users**, **Properties**, **Bookings**, **Reviews**, and **Payments**, and models how they relate to one another.

### Users

Represents both guests and hosts.

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Unique email address
- `role`: Either 'guest' or 'host'
- `created_at`: Date the account was created

**Relationships**:

- A user can list **multiple properties** (if host)
- A user can make **multiple bookings** (if guest)
- A user can write **multiple reviews**

---

### Properties

Represents listings that can be booked.

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Name of the property
- `description`: Property details
- `price_per_night`: Cost per night
- `host_id`: Foreign key to the user who owns the property

**Relationships**:

- A property belongs to **one host (user)**
- A property can have **multiple bookings**
- A property can have **multiple reviews**

---

### Bookings

Represents a reservation made by a user.

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `guest_id`: Foreign key to the user making the booking
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the booked property
- `check_in`: Start date of booking
- `check_out`: End date of booking

**Relationships**:

- A booking is made by **one guest (user)**
- A booking is for **one property**
- A booking has **one payment**

---

### Reviews

Represents feedback given by guests after a stay.

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the user who wrote the review
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the property being reviewed
- `rating`: Numeric score
- `comment`: Written feedback

**Relationships**:

- A review is written by **one user**
- A review is for **one property**

---

### Payments

Represents payment details for a booking.

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key to the associated booking
- `amount`: Total paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., card, PayPal
- `status`: Paid, pending, failed

**Relationships**:

- A payment is linked to **one booking**

## Feature Breakdown

1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security

Security is a critical component of this project to protect users, their data, and financial transactions. Below are the key API security measures that will be implemented:

---

### Authentication

Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints using secure login credentials or tokens (e.g., JWT).

**Why it's important**:

- Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Protects sensitive data like emails, passwords, and booking history.

---

### Authorization

Verifies that authenticated users can only perform actions they are allowed to (e.g., a user can’t delete someone else’s property listing).

**Why it's important**:

- Ensures that users cannot access or modify resources that don’t belong to them.
- Helps enforce user roles (guest vs host vs admin).

---

### Rate Limiting

Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given time frame.

**Why it's important**:

- Protects the server from abuse and DDoS attacks.
- Prevents brute-force attempts on login and payment routes.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a crucial part of modern software development that helps automate testing, building, and deploying code. It ensures faster development cycles, reduces human error, and increases the reliability of application updates.Implementing CI/CD helps maintain a high-quality, scalable, and maintainable code

---

### What is CI/CD?

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically tests and merges code changes into the main branch after each commit or pull request.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys tested and approved changes to production or staging environments.

---

### Why It's Important for This Project

- **Code Quality:** Automated testing ensures new changes don’t break existing features.
- **Faster Delivery:** Automates builds and deployments, speeding up the release cycle.
- **Team Collaboration:** Makes it easier for multiple developers to work on the project simultaneously without conflicts.
- **Reliability:** Reduces the risk of bugs reaching production by catching issues early.

---

### Tools That Can Be Used

- **GitHub Actions:** For automating test, build, and deployment workflows.
- **Docker:** To containerize the application for consistent environments in development, testing, and production.
- **Heroku / Vercel / AWS / Render:** For hosting and deploying the backend or frontend apps.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL on cloud services:** For production-grade database management.
- **Sentry / LogRocket:** For error tracking and monitoring.
