# The Airbnb Clone Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. Built with  Django, MySQL, and GraphQL,Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Celery, Docker,CI/CD Pipelines.

## Team Roles

**Backend Developer**: Implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.  
**Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.  
**DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.  
**QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design

The database is designed to support the core features of an Airbnb-style booking platform. It includes essential entities like **Users**, **Properties**, **Bookings**, **Reviews**, and **Payments**, and models how they relate to one another.

### Users

Represents both guests and hosts.

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `name`: Full name of the user  
- `email`: Unique email address  
- `role`: Either 'guest' or 'host'  
- `created_at`: Date the account was created

**Relationships**:

- A user can list **multiple properties** (if host)  
- A user can make **multiple bookings** (if guest)  
- A user can write **multiple reviews**

---

### Properties

Represents listings that can be booked.

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `title`: Name of the property  
- `description`: Property details  
- `price_per_night`: Cost per night  
- `host_id`: Foreign key to the user who owns the property

**Relationships**:

- A property belongs to **one host (user)**  
- A property can have **multiple bookings**  
- A property can have **multiple reviews**

---

### Bookings

Represents a reservation made by a user.

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `guest_id`: Foreign key to the user making the booking  
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the booked property  
- `check_in`: Start date of booking  
- `check_out`: End date of booking

**Relationships**:

- A booking is made by **one guest (user)**  
- A booking is for **one property**  
- A booking has **one payment**

---

### Reviews

Represents feedback given by guests after a stay.

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `user_id`: Foreign key to the user who wrote the review  
- `property_id`: Foreign key to the property being reviewed  
- `rating`: Numeric score  
- `comment`: Written feedback

**Relationships**:

- A review is written by **one user**  
- A review is for **one property**

---

### Payments

Represents payment details for a booking.

- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `booking_id`: Foreign key to the associated booking  
- `amount`: Total paid  
- `payment_method`: e.g., card, PayPal  
- `status`: Paid, pending, failed

**Relationships**:

- A payment is linked to **one booking**

---

## Feature Breakdown

1. **API Documentation**
   - **OpenAPI Standard**: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard.
   - **Django REST Framework**: Provides a RESTful API for handling CRUD operations.
   - **GraphQL**: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism.

2. **User Authentication**
   - **Endpoints**: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
   - **Features**: Register new users, authenticate, and manage profiles.

3. **Property Management**
   - **Endpoints**: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
   - **Features**: CRUD for property listings.

4. **Booking System**
   - **Endpoints**: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
   - **Features**: Manage bookings, check-in/check-out.

5. **Payment Processing**
   - **Endpoints**: `/payments/`
   - **Features**: Handle transactions.

6. **Review System**
   - **Endpoints**: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
   - **Features**: Post and manage reviews.

7. **Database Optimizations**
   - **Indexing**: For fast retrieval.
   - **Caching**: Reduce database load.

## API Security

Security is a critical component of this project to protect users, their data, and financial transactions. Below are the key API security measures that will be implemented:

### Authentication

Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints using secure login credentials or tokens (e.g., JWT).

**Why it's important**:

- Prevents unauthorized access.
- Protects sensitive user data.

### Authorization

Verifies that authenticated users can only perform allowed actions.

**Why it's important**:

- Prevents users from accessing othersâ€™ data.
- Enforces roles (guest, host, admin).

### Rate Limiting

Limits how many requests a user can make in a time frame.

**Why it's important**:

- Prevents abuse and DDoS.
- Secures login and payment endpoints.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates testing, building, and deploying code to ensure reliability and speed.

### What is CI/CD?

- **CI**: Tests and integrates code after each commit.
- **CD**: Deploys tested code automatically.

### Why It's Important

- **Quality**: Automated testing catches bugs early.
- **Speed**: Faster releases and deployments.
- **Teamwork**: Allows smooth collaboration.
- **Reliability**: Ensures production safety.

### Tools That Can Be Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows.
- **Docker**: Containerization.
- **Heroku / Vercel / AWS / Render**: Deployment.
- **Cloud Databases**: PostgreSQL / MySQL.
- **Sentry / LogRocket**: Monitoring and error tracking.
